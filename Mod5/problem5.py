#5. Write a program that continuously asks the user to input a number. If the user enters 0, immediately stop asking for more numbers. Otherwise, print the number they entered. Sample interaction:
while True:
    num = int(input("Enter a number (0 to stop): "))
    if num == 0:
        print("Exiting...")
        break
    print("You entered", num)
