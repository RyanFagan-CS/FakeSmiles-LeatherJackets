# 1. Prompt the user for a word. Then, prompt the user for how many times they'd like that word repeated. Use the skills you learned in this module to print the word the correct number of times.
dupe = (input("what is the word you want duplicated? ")) #Asks user for a phrase/word
amnt = int(input("How many times do you want the word duplicated? ")) #Gets the amount to dupe word
print((dupe + " ") * amnt) #Prints word amnt they asked it to be printed.
